I developed an inventory management system as part of my recent project, focusing on generating bills, managing stock, and handling staff roles within an Android application. The system allows admins to add and update product details, which employees can then use to manually enter sales information and generate bills. The application also includes features for tracking stock levels, managing staff access, and displaying a dashboard for total inventory management. This project helped me sharpen my skills in Android development, database management, and user experience design, providing a comprehensive solution for managing inventory in real time.
